# ZatherEngine
ZatherEngine is a 3D game engine that helps you create awesome games!

# How to Build it?

ZatherEngine requires premake5 and raylib, so make sure to clone the repo of raylib first.

You'll need the premake5.lua file which you can find in the buildutils folder.
Put the file into the same directory as the premake5 executable, and make sure that directory is the one where the source folder is in.

Afterwards, run the premake executable from terminal with either the ``vs2019`` or ``vs2017`` option.
It should generate a solution file and more folders.

Then open the solution file and press CTRL+F5 to build it.
